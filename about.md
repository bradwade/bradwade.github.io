I am a web architect, a technical lead, a front-end web developer, Drupal specialist, and musician living in Portland, Oregon.

I've been building websites since 1998 for non-profit, startup, higher-education, government, music entertainment, television, publishing, retail, and health care clients. I've freelanced, ran my own business, worked at small start-ups, a Drupal shop, a digital agency, and for large international corporations. I've made websites for Sony Music, Time Inc., NBCU, and the Department of Energy. 

Currently, I'm the web development architect for a team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

This website is about my tech related adventures. Information about my music will be available in a forthcoming separate website.
