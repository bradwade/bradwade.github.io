I am a front-end web developer, drupal specialist, and a musician living in New York City.

I've been building websites since 1998 for non-profit, startup, higher-education, government, music entertainment, television, publishing, retail, and health care clients. I've freelanced, ran my own business, worked at small start-ups, a Drupal shop, a digital agency, and for large international corporations.

Currently, I'm the technical lead for a team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

This website is about my tech related adventures. Information about my music will be available in a forthcoming separate website.
